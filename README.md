## PhD source code, data, models and results

This repository contains all the source code, links to data, trained models, results, and other
supplementary material that were developed as part of the work for the PhD thesis: 
		
		"Trajectory Space Factorisation for Vision-Based Automated Sign Language
		Recognition", Mark Borg, University of Malta, March 2020.

The **supplementary report** accompanying the above thesis is available here: [Supplementary report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NUgVn98tGKCQokzE3jDwo4wKFMBiSrhO).

Material related to **Sign Language detection**:

Source code for signing detection is available at: [github.com/mark-borg/sign-language-detection.git](https://github.com/mark-borg/sign-language-detection.git), 
while the dataset ``Signing in the Wild'' can be found here: [github.com/mark-borg/Signing-in-the-Wild-dataset.git](https://github.com/mark-borg/Signing-in-the-Wild-dataset.git).

Material related to the **Body-part tracking pipeline**:

Skin detection source code and results can be found here: [skin detection](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PzurIahlbbQuw5zsjTNamhMsSd_yzECf).

Frame differencing source code and results can be found here: [frame differencing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gF7gN3V-5aJs6wJlvFf5BFaNDqale3yk).

Face detection source code and results can be found here: [Viola-Jones face detector](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13dlfWHnUAw1L3AQCERVvyy02IRoyWfbw), [MTCNN face detector](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rjb7mdpuZL9GAltc1t4_e-Sucw5P6QeD), and [face tracking and other misc experiments](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzrXEhIM-3AcWgv5R5woV13kwfQcJ9OQ).

KLT feature tracking source code and results can be found here: [KLT feature tracking](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vN-OG0KZ1rh9f8FX_ftiPyAD_JAYYzWX).

Source code and experimental results in KLT feature grouping can be found here: [KLT feature grouping](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lv1Emyia0l8JyHD9mQqpO0r9c6QwMNxu).

Code and experimental results of using OpenPose-based features instead of the KLT features can be found here: [OpenPose based hand features](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TF3lOk46sn8S0e170cBY1Nk7MI6FBoYq).

And groundtruth related to body-part tracking is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nlSk0A8erhJM48wXp48fjEyDB-BE1Lzf). A rudimentary tool was developed for doing basic groundtruthing. This is included in the same folder. Compared to other tools, it has serious limitations; but it sufficed for the job at hand. 


--------------

Material related to **Trajectory Space Factorisation**:

Results of applying Structure from Motion (SfM) on the synthetic signing dataset, and the dataset itself, can be found at: [Synthetic Signing dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U0RwNAKTSnOI2ClrXZQz6ZuBXtJ773_B).

Experimental results in using the factorisation method for motion segmentation can be found here: [factorisation-based motion segmentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CJodjlLMyJckCPcLojXoPHaay-0BUByR).



--------------

Material related to **Sign Recognition**:

The lexicon and associated files used in the supervised training of both the HMM-based sign recognition system and the RNN-based system can be found here: [lexicon and associated labelling tools](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DqPHf28c7MBvObsBUP1GzI7YLiNmYjnI). The ELAN tool is needed for the EAF files; this is available here: [ELAN tool](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan).
