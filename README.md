## PhD source code, data, models and results

This repository contains all the source code, links to data, trained models, results, and other
supplementary material that were developed as part of the work for the PhD thesis: 
		
		"Trajectory Space Factorisation for Vision-Based Automated Sign Language
		Recognition", Mark Borg, University of Malta, March 2020.
